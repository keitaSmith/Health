Web-2 Project

### About Us
We are a team of three young developers enrolled at the University of the West Indies. Our field of study is Computer Science,which means we think coding is cool. We view coding to be supplementary to the technology we utilize daily. Feel free to contribute to our project. 
### About This Project
This project was created in order to understand wordpress as it relates to php files, so that we could create a custom website by modifying or adding files to an existing wordpress theme; In this case, the [Infruit Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/infruit/)
### What is Our Custom Website About
The Custom website is about providing information about the Corona Virus, in particular Covid-19. It uses information from The World Health Organisation and The Ministry of Health in Trinidad and Tobago. It also provides live updates on infections, deaths and recoveries using [COVID19 - Coronavirus Outbreak Data Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ce-corona/) as well as the official reports provided by the ministry of health relating to Covid-19 cases in Trinidad and Tobago. Our website also includes a blog post area for users to share their personal experiences as it relates to Covid-19.
### What Makes Our Site Unique?
Our site aims to help organisations and people who are struggling because they can't work or people whose situation have worsened due to the drastic decrease in social aid since less people go out to help. For example the homeless are suffering alot more now because people aren't around to help them with spare change or food or even small one day jobs to help them get by.
Secondly for people who are not necessarily having a hard time during the pandemic but would like to keep extra safe by not leaving the house, our site offers Food Delivery Services. With these Services you can pay someone to deliver fresh produce to your home.
**Note that both of these features are done using Cusom Post Types.**
